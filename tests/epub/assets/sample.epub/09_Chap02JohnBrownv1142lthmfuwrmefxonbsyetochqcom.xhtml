To be sure, that means nothing, and that is how things which mean nothing all of a sudden signify something, but in a quite different domain. If one of them sends a message to the other, for example a square, the being going in the opposite direction will first of all see the square vanishing, before seeing the square. That is what we see as well. The symptom initially appears to us as a trace, which will only ever be a trace, one which will continue not to be understood until the analysis has got quite a long way, and until we have realized its meaning.<sup><a href="16_NotesJohnBrownvlthmfuwrmefx8621onbsyetochqcom.xhtml#ch2fn1" id="ch2fnr1">1</a></sup></p></blockquote><p class="noindent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">The analysis is thus conceived as a symbolization, a symbolic integration of meaningless imaginary traces; this conception implies a fundamentally <a id="page_58"/><i>imaginary</i> character of the unconscious: it is made of &#x2018;imaginary fixations which could not have been assimilated to the symbolic development&#x2019; of the subject&#x2019;s history; consequently, it is &#x2018;something which will be realized in the Symbolic, or, more precisely, something which, thanks to the symbolic progress which takes place in the analysis, <i>will have been</i> &#x2018;.<sup><a href="16_NotesJohnBrownvlthmfuwrmefx8621onbsyetochqcom.xhtml#ch2fn2" id="ch2fnr2">2</a></sup></p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">The Lacanian answer to the question &#x2018;From where does the repressed return?&#x2019; is therefore, paradoxically, &#x2018;From the future.&#x2019; Symptoms are meaningless traces, their meaning is not discovered, excavated from the hidden depth of the past, but constructed retroactively &#x2013; the analysis produces the truth; that is, the signifying frame which gives the symptoms their symbolic place and meaning. As soon as we enter the symbolic order, the past is always present in the form of historical tradition and the meaning of these traces is not given; it changes continually with the transformations of the signifier&#x2019;s network. Every historical rupture, every advent of a new master-signifier, changes retroactively the meaning of all tradition, restructures the narration of the past, makes it readable in another, new way.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">Thus, &#x2018;things which mean nothing all of a sudden signify something, but in a quite different domain&#x2019;. What is a &#x2018;journey into the future&#x2019; if not this &#x2018;overtaking&#x2019; by means of which we suppose in advance the presence in the other of a certain knowledge &#x2013; knowledge about the meaning of our symptoms &#x2013; what is it, then, if not the <i>transference</i> itself? This knowledge is an illusion, it does not really exist in the other, the other does not really possess it, it is constituted afterwards, through our &#x2013; the subject&#x2019;s &#x2013; signifier&#x2019;s working; but it is at the same time a necessary illusion, because we can paradoxically elaborate this knowledge only by means of the illusion that the other already possesses it and that we are only discovering it.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">If &#x2013; as Lacan points out &#x2013; in the symptom, the repressed content is returning from the future and not from the past, then the transference &#x2013; the actualization of the reality of the unconscious &#x2013; must transpose us into the future, not into the past. And what is the &#x2018;journey into the past&#x2019; <a id="page_59"/>if not this retroactive working-through, elaboration, of the signifier itself? &#x2013; a kind of hallucinatory <i>mise-en-sc&#x00E8;ne</i> of the fact that in the field of the signifier and only in this field, we can change, we can bring about the past?</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">The past exists as it is included, as it enters (into) the synchronous net of the signifier &#x2013; that is, as it is symbolized in the texture of the historical memory &#x2013; and that is why we are all the time &#x2018;rewriting history&#x2019;, retroactively giving the elements their symbolic weight by including them in new textures &#x2013; it is this elaboration which decides retroactively what they &#x2018;will have been&#x2019;. The Oxford philosopher Michael Dummett has written two very interesting articles included in his collection of essays <i>Truth and Other Enigmas</i> : &#x2018;Can an Effect Precede its Cause?&#x2019; and &#x2018;Bringing About the Past&#x2019;: the Lacanian answer to these two enigmas would be: yes, because the symptom as a &#x2018;return of the repressed&#x2019; is precisely such an effect which precedes its cause (its hidden kernel, its meaning), and in working through the symptom we are precisely &#x2018;bringing about the past&#x2019; &#x2013; we are producing the symbolic reality of past, long-forgotten traumatic events.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">One is therefore tempted to see in the &#x2018;time paradox&#x2019; of science-fiction novels a kind of hallucinatory &#x2018;apparition in the Real&#x2019; of the elementary structure of the symbolic process, the so-called internal, internally inverted eight: a circular movement, a kind of snare where we can progress only in such a manner that we &#x2018;overtake&#x2019; ourselves in the transference, to find ourselves later at a point at which we have already been. The paradox consists in the fact that this superfluous detour, this supplementary snare of overtaking ourselves (&#x2018;voyage into the future&#x2019;) and then reversing the time direction (&#x2018;voyage into the past&#x2019;) is not just a subjective illusion/perception of an objective process taking place in so-called reality independently of these illusions. That supplementary snare is, rather, an internal condition, an internal constituent of the so-called &#x2018;objective&#x2019; process itself: only through this additional detour does the past itself, the &#x2018;objective&#x2019; state of things, become retroactively what it always was.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">Transference is, then, an illusion, but the point is that we cannot bypass it and reach directly for the Truth: the Truth itself is constituted <i>through</i> <a id="page_60"/>the illusion proper to the transference &#x2013; &#x2018;the Truth arises from misrecognition&#x2019; (Lacan). If this paradoxical structure is not yet clear, let us take another science-fiction example, William Tenn&#x2019;s well-known story &#x2018;The Discovery of Morniel Mathaway&#x2019;. A distinguished art historian takes a journey in a time machine from the twenty-fifth century to our day to visit and study <i>in vivo</i> the immortal Morniel Mathaway, a painter not appreciated in our time but later discovered to have been the greatest painter of the era. When he encounters him, the art historian finds no trace of a genius, just an imposter, a megalomaniac, even a swindler who steals his time machine from him and escapes into the future, so that the poor art historian stays tied to our time. The only action open to him is to assume the identity of the escaped Mathaway and to paint under his name all his masterpieces that he remembers from the future &#x2013; it is he himself who is really the misrecognized genius he was looking for!</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">This, therefore, is the basic paradox we are aiming at: the subject is confronted with a scene from the past that he wants to change, to meddle with, to intervene in; he takes a journey into the past, intervenes in the scene, and it is not that he &#x2018;cannot change anything&#x2019; &#x2013; quite the contrary, only through his intervention does the scene from the past <i>become what it always was:</i> his intervention was from the beginning comprised, included. The initial &#x2018;illusion&#x2019; of the subject consists in simply forgetting to include in the scene his own act &#x2013; that is, to overlook how &#x2018;it counts, it is counted, and the one who counts is already included in the account&#x2019;.<sup><a href="16_NotesJohnBrownvlthmfuwrmefx8621onbsyetochqcom.xhtml#ch2fn3" id="ch2fnr3">3</a></sup> This introduces a relationship between truth and misrecognition/misapprehension by which the Truth, literally, arises from misrecognition, as in the well-known story about the &#x2018;appointment in Samarra&#x2019; (from Somerset Maugham&#x2019;s play <i>Sheppey</i>):</p><blockquote><p class="noindent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">DEATH: There was a merchant in Bagdad who sent his servant to market to buy provisions and in a little while the servant came back, white and trembling, and said, Master, just now when I was in the <a id="page_61"/>market-place, I was jostled by a woman in the crowd and when I turned I saw it was death that jostled me. She looked at me and made a threatening gesture; now, lend me your horse, and I will ride away from this city and avoid my fate. I will go to Samarra and there death will not find me. The merchant lent him his horse, and the servant mounted it, and he dug his spurs in its flanks and as fast as the horse could gallop he went. Then the merchant went down to the marketplace and he saw me standing in the crowd and he came to me and said, Why did you make a threatening gesture to my servant when you saw him this morning? That was not a threatening gesture, I said, it was only a start of surprise. I was astonished to see him in Bagdad, for I had an appointment with him tonight in Samarra.</p></blockquote><p class="noindent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">We find the same structure in the myth of Oedipus: it is <i>predicted</i> to Oedipus&#x2019;s father that his son will kill him and marry his mother, and the prophecy realizes itself, &#x2018;becomes true&#x2019;, through the father&#x2019;s attempt to evade it (he exposes his little son in the forest, and so Oedipus, not recognizing him when he encounters him twenty years later, kills him &#x2026; ). In other words, the prophecy becomes true by means of its being communicated to the persons it affects and by means of his or her attempt to elude it: one knows in advance one&#x2019;s destiny, one tries to evade it, and it is by means of this very attempt that the predicted destiny realizes itself. Without the prophecy, the little Oedipus would live happily with his parents and there would be no &#x2018;Oedipus complex&#x2019; &#x2026;</p><p class="noindent1 EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart"><i>Repetition in History</i></p><p class="noindent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">The time structure with which we are concerned here is such that it is mediated through subjectivity: the subjective &#x2018;mistake&#x2019;, &#x2018;fault&#x2019;, &#x2018;error&#x2019;, misrecognition, arrives paradoxically <i>before</i> the truth in relation to which we are designating it as &#x2018;error&#x2019;, because this &#x2018;truth&#x2019; itself becomes true only through &#x2013; or, to use a Hegelian term, by mediation of &#x2013; the error. This is the logic of the unconscious &#x2018;cunning&#x2019;, the way the unconscious <a id="page_62"/>deceives us: the unconscious is not a kind of transcendent, unattainable thing of which we are unable to take cognizance, it is rather &#x2013; to follow Lacan&#x2019;s wordplay-translation of <i>Unbewusste</i> &#x2013; <i>une b&#x00E9;vue</i>, an overlooking: we overlook the way our act is already part of the state of things we are looking at, the way our error is part of the Truth itself. This paradoxical structure in which the Truth arises from misrecognition also gives us the answer to the question: why is the transference necessary, why must the analysis go through it? The transference is an essential illusion by means of which the final Truth (the meaning of a symptom) is produced.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">We find the same logic of the error as an internal condition of truth with Rosa Luxemburg, with her description of the dialectics of the revolutionary process. We are alluding here to her argument against Eduard Bernstein, against his revisionist fear of seizing power &#x2018;too soon&#x2019;, &#x2018;prematurely&#x2019;, before the so-called &#x2018;objective conditions&#x2019; had ripened &#x2013; this was, as is well known, Bernstein&#x2019;s main reproach to the revolutionary wing of social democracy: they are too impatient, they want to hasten, to outrun the objective logic of historical development. Rosa Luxemburg&#x2019;s answer is that the first seizures of power <i>are necessarily &#x2018;premature&#x2019;</i> : the only way for the working class to reach its &#x2018;maturity&#x2019;, to await the arrival of the &#x2018;appropriate moment&#x2019; for the seizure of power, is to form itself, to educate itself for this act of seizure, and the only possible way of achieving this education is precisely the &#x2018;premature&#x2019; attempts &#x2026; If we merely wait for the &#x2018;appropriate moment&#x2019; we will never live to see it, because this &#x2018;appropriate moment&#x2019; cannot arrive without the subjective conditions of the maturity of the revolutionary force (subject) being fulfilled &#x2013; that is, it can arrive only after a series of &#x2018;premature&#x2019;, failed attempts. The opposition to the &#x2018;premature&#x2019; seizure of power is thus revealed as opposition to the seizure of power <i>as such</i>, <i>in general</i> : to repeat Robespierre&#x2019;s famous phrase, the revisionists want a &#x2018;revolution without revolution&#x2019;.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">If we look at this closely, we perceive that what is at stake in Rosa Luxemburg&#x2019;s argument is precisely the impossibility of metalanguage in the revolutionary process: the revolutionary subject does not &#x2018;conduct&#x2019;, &#x2018;direct&#x2019; this process from an objective distance, he is constituted through <a id="page_63"/>this process, and because of this &#x2013; because the temporality of the revolution passes through subjectivity &#x2013; we cannot &#x2018;make the revolution at the right moment&#x2019; without the previous &#x2018;premature&#x2019;, failed attempts. Here, in the opposition between Bernstein and Luxemburg, we have the opposition between the obsessional (man) and the hysterical (woman): the obsessional is delaying, putting off the act, waiting for the right moment, while the hysteric (so to speak) overtakes herself in her act and thus unmasks the falsity of the obsessional&#x2019;s position. This is also what is at stake in Hegel&#x2019;s theory of the role of repetition in history: &#x2018;a political revolution is generally sanctioned by the opinion of the people only when it is renewed&#x2019; &#x2013; that is, it can succeed only as a repetition of a first failed attempt. Why this need for repetition?</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">Hegel developed his theory of repetition apropos of the case of Julius Caesar&#x2019;s death: when Caesar consolidated his personal power and strengthened it to imperial proportions, he acted &#x2018;objectively&#x2019; (in itself) in accordance with historical truth, historical necessity &#x2013; the Republican form was losing its validity, the only form of government which could save the unity of the Roman state was monarchy, a state based upon the will of a single individual; but it was still the Republic which prevailed formally (for itself, in the opinion of the people) &#x2013; the Republic &#x2018;was still alive only because she forgot that she was already dead&#x2019;, to paraphrase the famous Freudian dream of the father who did not know he was already dead: &#x2018;<i>His father was alive once more and was talking to him in his usual way</i>, <i>but</i> [the remarkable thing was tha] <i>he had really died</i>, <i>only he did not know it</i>&#x2019;.<sup><a href="16_NotesJohnBrownvlthmfuwrmefx8621onbsyetochqcom.xhtml#ch2fn4" id="ch2fnr4">4</a></sup></p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">To the &#x2018;opinion&#x2019; which still believed in the Republic, Caesar&#x2019;s amassing of personal power &#x2013; which was, of course, contrary to the spirit of the Republic &#x2013; appeared an arbitrary act, an expression of contingent individual self-will: the conclusion was that if this individual (Caesar) were to be removed, the Republic would regain its full splendour. But it was precisely the conspirators against Caesar (Brutus, Cassius, and the others) who &#x2013; following the logic of the &#x2018;cunning of reason&#x2019; &#x2013; attested the Truth (that <a id="page_64"/>is, the historical necessity) of Caesar: the final result, the outcome of Caesar&#x2019;s murder, was the reign of Augustus, the first <i>caesar</i>. The Truth thus arose from failure itself: in failing, in missing its express goal, the murder of Caesar fulfilled the task which was, in a Machiavellian way, assigned to it by history: to exhibit the historical necessity by denouncing its own non-truth &#x2013; its own arbitrary, contingent character.<sup><a href="16_NotesJohnBrownvlthmfuwrmefx8621onbsyetochqcom.xhtml#ch2fn5" id="ch2fnr5">5</a></sup></p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">The whole problem of repetition is here: in this passage from Caesar (the name of an individual) to caesar (title of the Roman emperor). The murder of Caesar &#x2013; historical personality &#x2013; provoked, as its final result, the installation of <i>caesarism: Caesar-person repeats itself as caesar-title</i>. What is the reason, the driving force, of this repetition? At first sight the answer seems to be clear: the delay of the consciousness as to the &#x2018;objective&#x2019; historical necessity. A certain act through which breaks historical necessity is perceived by the consciousness (the &#x2018;opinion of the people&#x2019;) as arbitrary, as something which also could not have happened; because of this perception people try to do away with its consequences, to restore the old state of things, but when this act repeats itself it is finally perceived as an expression of the underlying historical necessity. In other words, repetition is the way historical necessity asserts itself in the eyes of &#x2018;opinion&#x2019;.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">But such an idea of repetition rests upon the epistemologically naive presupposition of an objective historical necessity, persisting independently of consciousness (of the &#x2018;opinion of the people&#x2019;) and asserting itself finally through repetition. What is lost in this notion is the way so-called historical necessity itself <i>is constituted through misrecognition</i>, through the initial failure of &#x2018;opinion&#x2019; to recognize its true character &#x2013; that is, the way truth itself arises from misrecognition. The crucial point here is the changed symbolic status of an event: when it erupts for the first time it is experienced as a contingent trauma, as an intrusion of a certain non-symbolized Real; only through repetition is this event recognized in its symbolic necessity &#x2013; it finds its place in the symbolic network; it is <a id="page_65"/>realized in the symbolic order. But as with Moses in Freud&#x2019;s analysis, this recognition-through-repetition presupposes necessarily the crime, the act of murder: to realize himself in his symbolic necessity &#x2013; as a power-title &#x2013; Caesar has to die as an empirical, flesh-and-blood personality, precisely because the &#x2018;necessity&#x2019; in question is a <i>symbolic</i> one.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">It is not only that in its first form of appearance, the event (for example, Caesar&#x2019;s amassing of individual power) was too traumatic for the people to grasp its real signification &#x2013; the misrecognition of its first advent is immediately &#x2018;internal&#x2019; to its symbolic necessity, it is an immediate constituent of its final recognition. The first murder (the parricide of Caesar) opened up the guilt, and it was this guilt, this debt, which was the real driving force of the repetition. The event did not repeat itself because of some objective necessity, independent of our subjective inclination and thus irresistible, but because its repetition was a repayment of our symbolic debt.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">In other words, the repetition announces the advent of the Law, of the Name-of-the-Father in place of the dead, assassinated father: the event which repeats itself receives its law retroactively, through repetition. That is why we can grasp Hegelian repetition as a passage from a lawless series to a lawlike series, as the inclusion of a lawless series &#x2013; as <i>a gesture of interpretation</i> par excellence, as a symbolic appropriation of a traumatic, non-symbolized event (according to Lacan, interpretation always proceeds under the sign of the Name-of-the-Father). Hegel was thus probably the first to articulate the <i>delay</i> which is constitutive of the act of interpretation: the interpretation always sets in too late, with some delay, when the event which is to be interpreted repeats itself; the event cannot already be lawlike in its first advent. This same delay is also formulated in the Preface to Hegel&#x2019;s <i>Philosophy of the Law</i>, in the famous passage about the owl of Minerva (that is, the philosophical comprehension of a certain epoch), which takes flight only in the evening after this epoch has already come to its end.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">The fact that the &#x2018;opinion of the people&#x2019; saw in Caesar&#x2019;s action an individual contingency and not an expression of historical necessity is <a id="page_66"/>therefore not a simple case of &#x2018;delay of the consciousness in relation to the effectivity&#x2019;: the point is that this necessity itself &#x2013; which was misrecognized by opinion in its first manifestation; that is, mistaken for a contingent self-will &#x2013; constitutes itself, realizes itself, <i>through</i> this misrecognition. And we should not be surprised to find the same logic of repetition in the history of the psychoanalytic movement: it was necessary for Lacan to <i>repeat</i> his split with the International Psycho-Analytical Association. The first split (in 1953) was still experienced as a traumatic contingency &#x2013; Lacanians were still trying to patch things up with the IPA, to regain admission &#x2013; but in 1964 it also became clear to their &#x2018;opinion&#x2019; that there was a necessity in this split, so they cut their links with the IPA and Lacan constituted his own School.</p><p class="noindent1 EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart"><i>Hegel with Austen</i></p><p class="noindent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">Austen, not Austin: it is Jane Austen who is perhaps the only counterpart to Hegel in literature: <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> is the literary <i>Phenomenology of Spirit</i> ; <i>Mansfield Park</i> the <i>Science of Logic</i> and <i>Emma</i> the <i>Encyclopaedia</i> &#x2026; No wonder, then, that we find in <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> the perfect case of this dialectic of truth arising from misrecognition. Although they belong to different social classes &#x2013; he is from an extremely rich aristocratic family, she from the impoverished middle classes &#x2013; Elizabeth and Darcy feel a strong mutual attraction. Because of his pride, his love appears to Darcy as something unworthy; when he asks for Elizabeth&#x2019;s hand he confesses openly his contempt for the world to which she belongs and expects her to accept his proposition as an unheard-of honour. But because of her prejudice, Elizabeth sees him as ostentatious, arrogant and vain: his condescending proposal humiliates her, and she refuses him.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">This double failure, this mutual misrecognition, possesses a structure of a double movement of communication where each subject receives from the other its own message in the inverse form: Elizabeth wants to present herself to Darcy as a young cultivated woman, full of wit, and she gets from him the message &#x2018;you are nothing but a poor empty-minded creature, <a id="page_67"/>full of false <i>finesse</i>&#x2019;; Darcy wants to present himself to her as a proud gentleman, and he gets from her the message &#x2018;your pride is nothing but contemptible arrogance&#x2019;. After the break in their relationship each discovers, through a series of accidents, the true nature of the other &#x2013; she the sensitive and tender nature of Darcy, he her real dignity and wit &#x2013; and the novel ends as it should, with their marriage.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">The theoretical interest of this story lies in the fact that the failure of their first encounter, the double misrecognition concerning the real nature of the other, functions as a positive condition of the final outcome: we cannot go directly for the truth, we cannot say, &#x2018;If, from the very beginning, she had recognized his real nature and he hers, their story could have ended at once with their marriage.&#x2019; Let us take as a comical hypothesis that the first encounter of the future lovers was a success &#x2013; that Elizabeth had accepted Darcy&#x2019;s first proposal. What would happen? Instead of being bound together in true love they would become a vulgar everyday couple, a liaison of an arrogant, rich man and a pretentious, empty-minded young girl. If we want to spare ourselves the painful roundabout route through the misrecognition, we miss the Truth itself: only the &#x2018;working-through&#x2019; of the misrecognition allows us to accede to the true nature of the other and at the same time to overcome our own deficiency &#x2013; for Darcy, to free himself of his false pride; for Elizabeth, to get rid of her prejudices.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">These two movements are interconnected because Elizabeth encounters, in Darcy&#x2019;s pride, the inverse image of her own prejudices; and Darcy, in Elizabeth&#x2019;s vanity, the inverse image of his own false pride. In other words, Darcy&#x2019;s pride is not a simple, positive state of things existing independently of his relationship with Elizabeth, an immediate property of his nature; it takes place, it appears, <i>only from the perspective of her prejudices</i>, vice versa, Elizabeth is a pretentious empty-minded girl <i>only in Darcy&#x2019;s arrogant view</i>. To articulate things in Hegelian terms: in the perceived deficiency of the other, <i>each perceives</i> &#x2013; without knowing it &#x2013; <i>the falsity of his/her own subjective position</i>; the deficiency of the other is simply an objectification of the distortion of our own point of view.</p><p class="noindent1 EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart"><a id="page_68"/><i>Two Hegelian jokes</i></p><p class="noindent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">There is a well-known, very Hegelian joke that illustrates perfectly the way truth arises from misrecognition &#x2013; the way our path towards truth coincides with the truth itself. At the beginning of this century, a Pole and a Jew were sitting in a train, facing each other. The Pole was shifting nervously, watching the Jew all the time; something was irritating him; finally, unable to restrain himself any longer, he exploded: &#x2018;Tell me, how do you Jews succeed in extracting from people the last small coin and in this way accumulate all your wealth?&#x2019; The Jew replied: &#x2018;OK, I will tell you, but not for nothing; first, you give me five zloty [Polish money].&#x2019; After receiving the required amount, the Jew began: &#x2018;First, you take a dead fish; you cut off her head and put her entrails in a glass of water. Then, around midnight, when the moon is full, you must bury this glass in a churchyard &#x2026; &#x2018; &#x2018;And,&#x2019; the Pole interrupted him greedily, &#x2018;if I do all this, will I also become rich?&#x2019; &#x2018;Not too quickly,&#x2019; replied the Jew; &#x2018;This is not all you must do; but if you want to hear the rest, you must pay me another five zloty!&#x2019; After receiving the money again, the Jew continued his story; soon afterwards, he again demanded more money, and so on, until finally the Pole exploded in fury: &#x2018;You dirty rascal, do you really think I did not notice what you were aiming at? There is no secret at all, you simply want to extract the last small coin from me!&#x2019; The Jew answered him calmly and with resignation: &#x2018;Well, now you see how we, the Jews &#x2026; &#x2019;</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">Everything in this small story is susceptible to interpretation, starting with the curious, inquisitive way the Pole looks at the Jew &#x2013; it means that from the very beginning the Pole is caught in a relationship of transference: that the Jew embodies for him the &#x2018;subject presumed to know&#x2019; &#x2013; to know the secret of extracting money from people. The point of the story is of course that the Jew has <i>not</i> deceived the Pole: he kept his promise and taught him how to extract money from people. What is crucial here is the double movement of the outcome &#x2013; the distance between the moment when the Pole breaks out in fury and the Jew&#x2019;s final answer. When the <a id="page_69"/>Pole blurts out &#x2018;There is no secret at all, you simply want to extract the last small coin from me!&#x2019;, he is already telling the truth without knowing it &#x2013; that is to say, he sees, in the Jew&#x2019;s manipulation, a simple deception. What he misses is that through this very deception the Jew kept his word, delivered him what he was paid for (the secret of how the Jews &#x2026; ). The Pole&#x2019;s error is simply his perspective: he looks forward to the &#x2018;secret&#x2019; being revealed somewhere at the end; he situates the Jew&#x2019;s narration as a path to the final revelation of the &#x2018;secret&#x2019;; but the real &#x2018;secret&#x2019; is already in the narration itself: in the way the Jew, through his narration, captures the Pole&#x2019;s desire; in the way the Pole is absorbed in this narration and prepared to pay for it.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">The Jew&#x2019;s &#x2018;secret&#x2019; lies, then, in our own (the Pole&#x2019;s) desire: in the fact that the Jew knows how to take our desire into account. That is why we can say that the final turn of the story, with its double twist, corresponds to the final moment of the psychoanalytic cure, the dissolution of transference and &#x2018;going through the fantasy&#x2019;: when the Pole breaks out in fury he has already stepped out of transference, but he has yet to traverse his fantasy &#x2013; this is achieved only by realizing how, through his deception, the Jew has kept his word. The fascinating &#x2018;secret&#x2019; which drives us to follow the Jew&#x2019;s narration carefully is precisely the Lacanian <i>objet petit a</i>, the chimerical object of fantasy, the object causing our desire and at the same time &#x2013; this is its paradox &#x2013; posed retroactively by this desire; in &#x2018;going through the fantasy&#x2019; we experience how this fantasy-object (the &#x2018;secret&#x2019;) only materializes the void of our desire.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">Another well-known joke possesses exactly the same structure, but this is usually overlooked &#x2013; we are referring, of course, to the joke about the Door of the Law from the ninth chapter of Kafka&#x2019;s <i>Trial</i>, to its final turnaround when the dying man from the country asks the door-keeper:</p><blockquote><p class="noindent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">&#x2018;Everyone strives to attain the law, how does it come about, then, that in all these years no one has come seeking admittance but me?&#x2019; The door-keeper perceives that the man is at the end of his strength and his hearing is failing, so he bellows in his ear: &#x2018;No one but you could <a id="page_70"/>gain admittance through this door, since the door was intended only for you. I am now going to shut it.&#x2019;<sup><a href="16_NotesJohnBrownvlthmfuwrmefx8621onbsyetochqcom.xhtml#ch2fn6" id="ch2fnr6">6</a></sup></p></blockquote><p class="noindent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">This final twist is perfectly homologous to the one at the end of the story about the Pole and the Jew: the subject experiences how he (his desire) was part of the game from the very beginning, how the entrance was meant only for him, how the stake of the narration was only to capture his desire. We could even invent another ending for Kafka&#x2019;s story to bring it nearer to the joke about the Pole and the Jew: after the long wait, the man from the country breaks out in fury and begins to cry at the door-keeper: &#x2018;You dirty rascal, why do you pretend to guard the entrance to some enormous secret, when you know very well that there is no secret beyond the door, that this door is intended only for me, to capture my desire!&#x2019; and the door-keeper (if he were an analyst) would answer him calmly: &#x2018;You see, now you&#x2019;ve discovered the real secret: beyond the door is only what your desire introduces there &#x2026; &#x2019;</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">In both cases, the nature of the final twist follows the Hegelian logic of surmounting, of abolishing the &#x2018;bad infinity&#x2019;. That is to say, in both cases the starting point is the same: the subject is confronted with some substantial Truth, a secret from which he is excluded, which evades him <i>ad infinitum</i> &#x2013; the inaccessible heart of the Law beyond the infinite series of doors; the unattainable last answer, the last secret of how the Jews extract money from us, awaiting us at the end of the Jew&#x2019;s narration (which could go on <i>ad infinitum</i>). And the solution is the same in both cases: the subject has to grasp how, from the very start of the game, the door concealing the secret was meant only for him, how the real secret at the end of the Jew&#x2019;s narration is his own desire &#x2013; in short, how his external position <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> the Other (the fact that he experiences himself as excluded from the secret of the Other) is internal to the Other itself. Here we encounter a kind of &#x2018;reflexivity&#x2019; which cannot be reduced to philosophical reflection: the very feature which seems to exclude the subject from the Other (his <a id="page_71"/>desire to penetrate the secret of the Other &#x2013; the secret of the Law, the secret of how the Jews &#x2026; ) is already a &#x2018;reflexive determination&#x2019; of the Other; precisely as excluded from the Other, we are already part of its game.</p><p class="noindent1 EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart"><i>A time trap</i></p><p class="noindent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">The positivity proper to the misrecognition &#x2013; the fact that the misrecognition functions as a &#x2018;productive&#x2019; instance &#x2013; is to be conceived in an even more radical way: not only is the misrecognition an immanent condition of the final advent of the truth, but it already possesses in itself, so to speak, a positive ontological dimension: it founds, it renders possible a certain positive entity. To exemplify this let us refer again to science fiction, to one of the classic science-fiction novels, <i>The Door into Summer</i> by Robert A. Heinlein.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">The hypothesis of this novel (written in 1957) is that in 1970 hibernation has become an ordinary procedure, managed by numerous agencies. The hero, a young engineer by the name of Daniel Boone Davis, hibernates himself as a professional deception for thirty years. After his awakening in December 2000, he encounters &#x2013; among other adventures &#x2013; the old Dr Twitchell, a kind of &#x2018;mad genius&#x2019; who has constructed a time machine; Davis persuades Dr Twitchell to use this machine on him and to transpose him back into the year 1970. There our hero arranges his affairs (by investing his money in a company that he knows, from his voyage to 2000, will be a great success in thirty years&#x2019; time, and even by arranging for his own wedding in 2000: he organizes also the hibernation of his future bride) and then hibernates himself again for thirty years; the date of his second awakening is 27 April 2001.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">This way, all ends well &#x2013; there is just one small detail annoying the hero: in the year 2000, the newspapers publish, beside &#x2018;Births&#x2019;, &#x2018;Deaths&#x2019; and &#x2018;Marriages&#x2019;, also the column &#x2018;Awakenings&#x2019;, listing the names of all persons roused from hibernation. His <i>first</i> stay in the years 2000 and 2001 lasted from December 2000 until June 2001; this means that Doc Twitchell has transposed him back to the past <i>after</i> the date of his second awakening in April 2001. In <i>The Times</i> for Saturday 28 April 2001, there was of course his <a id="page_72"/>name in the list of those awakened on Friday 27 April: &#x2018;D. B. Davis&#x2019;. Why did he, during his <i>first</i> stay in 2001, miss his own name among the &#x2018;Awakenings&#x2019;, although he was all the time a very attentive reader of this column? Was this an accidental oversight?</p><blockquote><p class="noindent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">But what would I have done if I <i>had</i> seen it? Gone there, met myself &#x2013; and gone stark mad? No, for if I <i>had</i> seen it, I would not have done the things I did afterward &#x2013; &#x2018;afterward&#x2019; for me &#x2013; which led up to it. Therefore it could never have happened that way. The control is a negative feedback type, with a built-in &#x2018;fail safe&#x2019;, because the very existence of that line of print depended on my not seeing it; the apparent possibility that I might have seen it is one of the excluded &#x2018;not possibles&#x2019; on the basic circuit design. &#x2018;There&#x2019;s a divinity that shapes our ends, rough-hew them how we will.&#x2019; Free will and predestination in one sentence and both true.<sup><a href="16_NotesJohnBrownvlthmfuwrmefx8621onbsyetochqcom.xhtml#ch2fn7" id="ch2fnr7">7</a></sup></p></blockquote><p class="noindent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">Here we have the literal definition of the &#x2018;agency of the letter in the unconscious&#x2019;: the line &#x2018;the very existence of [which] depended on my not seeing it&#x2019;. If, during his first stay in 2001, the subject had perceived his own name in the newspaper &#x2013; if he had perceived during his first stay the trace of his second stay in 2001 &#x2013; he would have acted thereupon in a different manner (he would not have travelled back into the past, and so on): that is, <i>he would have acted in a way that would have prevented his name from appearing in the newspaper</i>. The oversight itself therefore has, so to speak, a negative ontological dimension: it is the &#x2018;condition of the possibility&#x2019; of the letter that it must be overlooked, that we must not take notice of it &#x2013; its very existence depends on its not being seen by the subject. Here we have a kind of inversion of the traditional <i>esse &#x2013; percipi</i>: it is the <i>non-percipi</i> which is the condition of <i>esse</i>. This is perhaps the right way to conceive the &#x2018;preontological&#x2019; status of the unconscious (evoked by Lacan in his <i>Seminar XI</i>): the unconscious is a paradoxical letter which <i>insists</i> only in so far as it does not <i>exist</i> ontologically.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart"><a id="page_73"/>In a homologous way, we could also determine the status of knowledge in psychoanalysis. The knowledge at work here is knowledge concerning the most intimate, traumatic being of the subject, knowledge about the particular logic of his enjoyment. In his everyday attitude, the subject refers to the objects of his <i>Umwelt</i>, of the world that surrounds him, as to some given positivity; psychoanalysis brings about a dizzy experience of how this given positivity exists and retains its consistency only in so far as somewhere else (on another scene, <i>an einem anderen Schauplatz</i>) some fundamental non-knowledge insists &#x2013; it brings about the terrifying experience that if we come to know too much, we may lose our very being.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">Let us take, for example, the Lacanian notion of the imaginary self: this self exists only on the basis of the misrecognition of its own conditions; it is the effect of this misrecognition. So Lacan&#x2019;s emphasis is not on the supposed incapacity of the self to reflect, to grasp its own conditions &#x2013; on its being the plaything of inaccessible unconscious forces: his point is that the subject can pay for such a reflection with the loss of his very ontological consistency. It is in this sense that the knowledge which we approach through psychoanalysis is impossible-real: we are on dangerous ground; in getting too close to it we observe suddenly how our consistency, our positivity, is dissolving itself.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">In psychoanalysis, knowledge is marked by a lethal dimension: the subject must pay the approach to it with his own being. In other words, to abolish the misrecognition means at the same time to abolish, to dissolve, the &#x2018;substance&#x2019; which was supposed to hide itself behind the form-illusion of misrecognition. This &#x2018;substance&#x2019; &#x2013; the only one recognized in psychoanalysis &#x2013; is, according to Lacan, enjoyment [<i>jouissance</i>]: access to knowledge is then paid with the loss of enjoyment &#x2013; enjoyment, in its stupidity, is possible only on the basis of certain non-knowledge, ignorance. No wonder, then, that the reaction of the analysand to the analyst is often paranoid: by driving him towards knowledge about his desire, the analyst wants effectively to steal from him his most intimate treasure, the kernel of his enjoyment.</p><p class="center-1 EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart"><a id="page_74"/>Symptom as Real</p><p class="noindent1 EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart"><i>The Titanic as symptom</i></p><p class="noindent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">This dialectics of overtaking ourselves towards the future and simultaneous retroactive modification of the past &#x2013; dialectics by which the error is internal to the truth, by which the misrecognition possesses a positive ontological dimension &#x2013; has, however, its limits; it stumbles on to a rock upon which it becomes suspended. This rock is of course the Real, that which resists symbolization: the traumatic point which is always missed but none the less always returns, although we try &#x2013; through a set of different strategies &#x2013; to neutralize it, to integrate it into the symbolic order. In the perspective of the last stage of Lacanian teaching, it is precisely the symptom which is conceived as such a real kernel of enjoyment, which persists as a surplus and returns through all attempts to domesticate it, to gentrify it (if we may be permitted to use this term adapted to designate strategies to domesticate the slums as &#x2018;symptoms&#x2019; of our cities), to dissolve it by means of explication, of putting-into-words its meaning.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">To exemplify this shift of emphasis in the concept of symptom in Lacan&#x2019;s teaching, let us take a case which is today again attracting public attention: the wreck of the <i>Titanic</i>. Of course, it is already a commonplace to read <i>Titanic</i> as a symptom in the sense of &#x2018;knot of meanings&#x2019;: the sinking of the <i>Titanic</i> had a traumatic effect, it was a shock, &#x2018;the impossible happened&#x2019;, the unsinkable ship had sunk; but the point is that precisely as a shock, this sinking arrived at its proper time &#x2013; &#x2018;the time was waiting for it&#x2019;: even before it actually happened, there was already a place opened, reserved for it in fantasy-space. It had such a terrific impact on the &#x2018;social imaginary&#x2019; by virtue of the fact that it was expected. It was foretold in amazing detail:</p><blockquote><p class="noindent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">In 1898 a struggling author named Morgan Robertson concocted a novel about a fabulous Atlantic liner, far larger than any that had ever been built. Robertson loaded his ship with rich and complacent people <a id="page_75"/>and then wrecked it one cold April night on an iceberg. This some-how showed the futility of everything, and in fact, the book was called <i>Futility</i> when it appeared that year, published by the firm of M. F. Mansfield.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">Fourteen years later a British shipping company named the White Star Line built a steamer remarkably like the one in Robertson&#x2019;s novel. The new liner was 66,000 tons displacement; Robertson&#x2019;s was 70,000. The real ship was 882.5 feet long; the fictional one was 800 feet. Both vessels were triple screw and could make 24&#x2013;25 knots. Both could carry about 3,000 people, and both had enough lifeboats for only a fraction of this number. But, then, this did not seem to matter because both were labeled &#x2018;unsinkable&#x2019;.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">On April 10, 1912, the real ship left Southampton on her maiden voyage to New York. Her cargo included a priceless copy of the <i>Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam</i> and a list of passengers collectively worth two hundred and fifty million dollars. On her way over she too struck an iceberg and went down on a cold April night.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">Robertson called his ship the <i>Titan</i> ; the White Star Line called its ship the <i>Titanic</i>.<sup><a href="16_NotesJohnBrownvlthmfuwrmefx8621onbsyetochqcom.xhtml#ch2fn8" id="ch2fnr8">8</a></sup></p></blockquote><p class="noindent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">The reasons, the background for this incredible coincidence, are not difficult to guess: at the turn of the century, it was already part of the <i>Zeitgeist</i> that a certain age was coming to an end &#x2013; the age of peaceful progress, of well-defined and stable class distinctions, and so on: that is, the long period from 1850 until the First World War. New dangers were hanging in the air (labour movements, eruptions of nationalism, anti-Semitism, the danger of war) which would soon tarnish the idyllic image of Western civilization, releasing its &#x2018;barbaric&#x2019; potentials. And if there was a phenomenon which, at the turn of the century, embodied the end of this age, it was the great transatlantic liners: floating palaces, wonders of technical progress; incredibly complicated and well-functioning machines, and at <a id="page_76"/>the same time the meeting-place of the cream of society; a kind of microcosm of the social structure, an image of society not as it really was but seen as society wanted to be seen in order to appear likeable, as a stable totality with well-defined class distinctions, and so on &#x2013; in brief: the ego-ideal of society.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">In other words, the wreck of the <i>Titanic</i> made such a tremendous impact not because of the immediate material dimensions of the catastrophe but because of its symbolic overdetermination, because of the ideological meaning invested in it: it was read as a &#x2018;symbol&#x2019;, as a condensed, metaphorical representation of the approaching catastrophe of European civilization itself. The wreck of the <i>Titanic</i> was a form in which society lived the experience of its own death, and it is interesting to note how both the traditional rightist and leftist readings retain this same perspective, with only shifts of emphasis. From the traditional perspective, the <i>Titanic</i> is a nostalgic monument of a bygone era of gallantry lost in today&#x2019;s world of vulgarity; from the leftist viewpoint, it is a story about the impotence of an ossified class society.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">But all these are commonplaces that could be found in any report on the <i>Titanic</i> &#x2013; we can easily explain, in this way, the metaphorical over-determination which confers on the <i>Titanic</i> its symbolic weight. The problem is that this is not all. We can easily convince ourselves of this by looking at the photos of the wreck of the <i>Titanic</i> taken recently by undersea cameras &#x2013; where lies the terrifying power of fascination exercised by these pictures? It is, so to speak, intuitively clear that this fascinating power cannot be explained by the symbolic over determination, by the metaphorical meaning of the <i>Titanic</i> : its last resort is not that of representation but that of a certain inert presence. The <i>Titanic</i> is a Thing in the Lacanian sense: the material leftover, the materialization of the terrifying, impossible <i>jouissance</i>. By looking at the wreck we gain an insight into the forbidden domain, into a space that should be left unseen: visible fragments are a kind of coagulated remnant of the liquid flux of <i>jouissance</i>, a kind of petrified forest of enjoyment.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">This terrifying impact has nothing to do with meaning &#x2013; or, more <a id="page_77"/>precisely, it is a meaning permeated with enjoyment, a Lacanian <i>jouissense</i>. The wreck of the <i>Titanic</i> therefore functions as a sublime object: a positive, material object elevated to the status of the impossible Thing. And perhaps all the effort to articulate the metaphorical meaning of the <i>Titanic</i> is nothing but an attempt to escape this terrifying impact of the Thing, an attempt to domesticate the Thing by reducing it to its symbolic status, by providing it with a meaning. We usually say that the fascinating presence of a Thing obscures its meaning; here, the opposite is true: the meaning obscures the terrifying impact of its presence.</p><p class="noindent1 EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart"><i>From symptom to sinthome</i></p><p class="noindent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">This, then, is the symptom &#x2013; and it is on the basis of this notion of the symptom that we must locate the fact that in the final years of Lacan&#x2019;s teaching we find a kind of universalization of the symptom: almost everything that is becomes in a way symptom, so that finally even woman is determined as the symptom of man. We can even say that &#x2018;symptom&#x2019; is Lacan&#x2019;s final answer to the eternal philosophical question &#x2018;Why is there something instead of nothing?&#x2019; &#x2013; this &#x2018;something&#x2019; which &#x2018;is&#x2019; instead of nothing is indeed the symptom.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">The general reference of the philosophical discussion is usually the triangle world &#x2013; language-subject, the relation of the subject to the world of objects, mediated through language; Lacan is usually reproached for his &#x2018;absolutism of the signifier&#x2019; &#x2013; the reproach is that he does not take into account the objective world, that he limits his theory to the interplay of subject and language; as if the objective world does not exist, as if it is only the imaginary effect-illusion of the signifier&#x2019;s play. But Lacan&#x2019;s answer to this reproach is that not only does the world &#x2013; as a given whole of objects &#x2013; not exist, but that neither do language and subject exist: it is already a classic Lacanian thesis that &#x2018;the big Other [that is, the symbolic order as a consistent, closed totality] does not exist&#x2019;, and the subject is denoted by S/, the crossed, blocked S, a void, an empty place in the signifier&#x2019;s structure.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart"><a id="page_78"/>At this point we must of course ask ourselves the naive but necessary question: if the world and language and subject do not exist, what <i>does</i> exist; more precisely: what confers on existing phenomena their consistency? Lacan&#x2019;s answer is, as we have already indicated, symptom. To this answer, we must give its whole anti-post-structuralist emphasis: the fundamental gesture of post-structuralism is to deconstruct every substantial identity, to denounce behind its solid consistency an interplay of symbolic overdetermination &#x2013; briefly, to dissolve the substantial identity into a network of non-substantial, differential relations; the notion of symptom is the necessary counterpoint to it, the substance of enjoyment, the real kernel around which this signifying interplay is structured.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">To seize the logic of this universalization of symptom, we must connect it with another universalization, that of foreclosure (<i>Verwerfung</i>). In his unpublished Seminar, J.-A. Miller ironically spoke of the passage from special to general theory of foreclosure (alluding, of course, to Einstein&#x2019;s passage from special to general theory of relativity). When Lacan introduced the notion of foreclosure in the 1950s, it designated a specific phenomenon of the exclusion of a certain key-signifier (<i>point de capiton</i>, Name-of-the-Father) from the symbolic order, triggering the psychotic process; here, the foreclosure is not proper to language as such but a distinctive feature of the psychotic phenomena. And, as Lacan reformulated Freud, what was foreclosed from the Symbolic returns in the Real &#x2013; in the form of hallucinatory phenomena, for example.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">However, in the last years of his teaching Lacan gave universal range to this function of foreclosure: there is a certain foreclosure proper to the order of signifier as such; whenever we have a symbolic structure it is structured around a certain void, it implies the foreclosure of a certain key-signifier. The symbolic structuring of sexuality implies the lack of a signifier of the sexual relationship, it implies that &#x2018;there is no sexual relationship&#x2019;, that the sexual relation cannot be symbolized &#x2013; that it is an impossible, &#x2018;antagonistic&#x2019; relationship. And to seize the interconnection between the two universalizations, we must simply again apply the proposition &#x2018;what was foreclosed from the Symbolic returns in the Real of the <a id="page_79"/>symptom&#x2019;: woman does not exist, her signifier is originally foreclosed, and that is why she returns as a symptom of man.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">Symptom as real &#x2013; this seems directly opposed to the classic Lacanian thesis that the unconscious is structured like a language: is not the symptom a symbolic formation par excellence, a cyphered, coded message which can be dissolved through interpretation because it is already in itself a signifier? Is not the whole point of Lacan that we must detect, behind the corporeal-imaginary mask (for example, of a hysterical symptom), its symbolic overdetermination? To explain this apparent contradiction, we must take into account the different stages of Lacan&#x2019;s development.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">We can use the concept of symptom as a kind of clue, or index, allowing us to differentiate the main stages of Lacan&#x2019;s theoretical development. At the beginning, in the early 1950s, a symptom was conceived as a symbolic, signifying formation, as a kind of cypher, a coded message addressed to the big Other which later was supposed to confer on it its true meaning. The symptom arises where the world failed, where the circuit of the symbolic communication was broken: it is a kind of &#x2018;prolongation of the communication by other means&#x2019;; the failed, repressed word articulates itself in a coded, cyphered form. The implication of this is that the symptom can not only be interpreted but is, so to speak, already formed with an eye to its interpretation: it is addressed to the big Other presumed to contain its meaning. In other words, there is no symptom without its addressee: in the psychoanalytic cure the symptom is always addressed to the analyst, it is an appeal to him to deliver its hidden meaning. We can also say that there is no symptom without transference, without the position of some subject presumed to know its meaning. Precisely as an enigma, the symptom, so to speak, announces its dissolution through interpretation: the aim of psychoanalysis is to re-establish the broken network of communication by allowing the patient to verbalize the meaning of his symptom: through this verbalization, the symptom is automatically dissolved. This, then, is the basic point: in its very constitution, the symptom implies the field of the big Other as consistent, complete, because its very formation is an appeal to the Other which contains its meaning.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart"><a id="page_80"/>But here the problems began: why, in spite of its interpretation, does the symptom not dissolve itself; why does it persist? The Lacanian answer is, of course, <i>enjoyment</i>. The symptom is not only a cyphered message, it is at the same time a way for the subject to organize his enjoyment &#x2013; that is why, even after the completed interpretation, the subject is not prepared to renounce his symptom; that is why he &#x2018;loves his symptom more than himself&#x2019;. In locating this dimension of enjoyment in the symptom, Lacan proceeded in two stages.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">First, he tried to isolate this dimension of enjoyment as that of <i>fantasy</i>, and to oppose symptom and fantasy through a whole set of distinctive features: symptom is a signifying formation which, so to speak, &#x2018;overtakes itself&#x2019; towards its interpretation &#x2013; that is, which can be analysed; fantasy is an inert construction which cannot be analysed, which resists interpretation. Symptom implies and addresses some non-barred, consistent big Other which will retroactively confer on it its meaning; fantasy implies a crossed-out, blocked, barred, non-whole, inconsistent Other &#x2013; that is to say, it is filling out a void in the Other. Symptom (for example, a slip of the tongue) causes discomfort and displeasure when it occurs, but we embrace its interpretation with pleasure; we explain gladly to others the meaning of our slips; their &#x2018;intersubjective recognition&#x2019; is usually a source of intellectual satisfaction. When we abandon ourselves to fantasy (for example, in daydreaming) we feel immense pleasure, but on the contrary it causes us great discomfort and shame to confess our fantasies to others.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">In this way we can also articulate two stages of the psychoanalytic process: <i>interpretation of symptoms &#x2013; going through fantasy</i>. When we are confronted with the patient&#x2019;s symptoms, we must first interpret them and penetrate through them to the fundamental fantasy as the kernel of enjoyment which is blocking the further movement of interpretation; then we must accomplish the crucial step of going through the fantasy, of obtaining distance from it, of experiencing how the fantasy-formation just masks, fills out a certain void, lack, empty place in the Other.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">But here again another problem arose: how do we account for patients who have, beyond any doubt, gone through their fantasy, who have <a id="page_81"/>obtained distance from the fantasy-framework of their reality, but whose key symptom still persists? How do we explain this fact? What do we do with a symptom, with this pathological formation which persists not only beyond its interpretation but even beyond fantasy? Lacan tried to answer this challenge with the concept of <i>sinthome</i>, a neologism containing a set of associations (synthetic-artificial man, synthesis between symptom and fantasy, Saint Thomas, the saint &#x2026; ).<sup><a href="16_NotesJohnBrownvlthmfuwrmefx8621onbsyetochqcom.xhtml#ch2fn9" id="ch2fnr9">9</a></sup> Symptom as <i>sinthome</i> is a certain signifying formation penetrated with enjoyment: it is a signifier as a bearer of <i>jouis-sense</i>, enjoyment-in-sense.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">What we must bear in mind here is the radical ontological status of symptom: symptom, conceived as <i>sinthome</i>, is literally our only substance, the only positive support of our being, the only point that gives consistency to the subject. In other words, symptom is the way we &#x2013; the subjects &#x2013; &#x2018;avoid madness&#x2019;, the way we &#x2018;choose something (the symptom-formation) instead of nothing (radical psychotic autism, the destruction of the symbolic universe)&#x2019; through the binding of our enjoyment to a certain signifying, symbolic formation which assures a minimum of consistency to our being-in-the-world.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">If the symptom in this radical dimension is unbound, it means literally &#x2018;the end of the world&#x2019; &#x2013; the only alternative to the symptom is nothing: pure autism, a psychic suicide, surrender to the death drive, even to the total destruction of the symbolic universe. That is why the final Lacanian definition of the end of the psychoanalytic process is <i>identification with the symptom</i>. The analysis achieves its end when the patient is able to recognize, in the Real of his symptom, the only support of his being. That is how we must read Freud&#x2019;s <i>wo es war</i>, <i>soll ich werden</i>: you, the subject, must identify yourself with the place where your symptom already was; in its &#x2018;pathological&#x2019; particularity you must recognize the element which gives consistency to your being.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">This, then, is a symptom: a particular, &#x2018;pathological&#x2019;, signifying formation, a binding of enjoyment, an inert stain resisting communication and <a id="page_82"/>interpretation, a stain which cannot be included in the circuit of discourse, of social bond network, but is at the same time a positive condition of it. Now it is perhaps clear why woman is, according to Lacan, a symptom of man &#x2013; to explain this, we need only remember the well-known male chauvinist wisdom often referred to by Freud: women are impossible to bear, a source of eternal nuisance, but still, they are the best thing we have of their kind; without them, it would be even worse. So if woman does not exist, man is perhaps simply a woman who thinks that she does exist.</p><p class="noindent1 EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart"><i>&#x2018;In you more than yourself&#x2019;</i></p><p class="noindent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">In so far as the <i>sinthome</i> is a certain signifier which is not enchained in a network but immediately filled, penetrated with enjoyment, its status is by definition &#x2018;psychosomatic&#x2019;, that of a terrifying bodily mark which is merely a mute attestation bearing witness to a disgusting enjoyment, without representing anything or anyone. Is not Franz Kafka&#x2019;s story &#x2018;A Country Doctor&#x2019; therefore the story of a <i>sinthome</i> in its pure &#x2013; distilled, so to speak &#x2013; form?

Rose-red, in many variations of shade, dark in the grooves, lighter at the edges, softly granulated, with irregular clots of blood, open as a surface-mine to the daylight. That was how it looked from a distance. But on a closer inspection there was another complication. I could not help a low whistle of surprise. Worms, as thick and as long as my little finger, themselves rose-red and blood-spotted as well, were wriggling from their fastness in the interior of the wound towards the light, with small white heads and many little legs. Poor young man, he was past helping. I had discovered his great wound; this blossom in his side was destroying him.<sup><a href="16_NotesJohnBrownvlthmfuwrmefx8621onbsyetochqcom.xhtml#ch2fn10" id="ch2fnr10">10</a></sup></p></blockquote><p class="noindent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart"><a id="page_83"/>&#x2018;In his right side, near the hips &#x2026; &#x2019; &#x2013; exactly like Christ&#x2019;s wound, although its closest forerunner is the suffering of Amfortas in Wagner&#x2019;s <i>Parsifal</i>. Amfortas&#x2019;s problem is that as long as his wound bleeds <i>he cannot die</i>, he cannot find peace in death; his attendants insist that he must do his duty and perform the Grail&#x2019;s ritual, regardless of his suffering, while he desperately asks them to have mercy on him and put an end to his suffering by simply killing him &#x2013; exactly like the child in &#x2018;A Country Doctor&#x2019;, who addresses the narrator-doctor with the desperate request: &#x2018;Doctor, let me die&#x2019;.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">At first sight, Wagner and Kafka are as far apart as they can be: on one hand, we have the late-Romantic revival of a medieval legend; on the other, the description of the fate of the individual in contemporary totalitarian bureaucracy &#x2026; but if we look closely we perceive that the fundamental problem of <i>Parsifal</i> is eminently a <i>bureaucratic</i> one: the incapacity, the incompetence of Amfortas in performing his ritual-bureaucratic duty. The terrifying voice of Amfortas&#x2019;s father Titurel, this superego-injunction of the living dead, addresses his impotent son in the first act with the words: &#x2018;Mein Sohn Amfortas, bist du am Amt?&#x2019;, to which we have to give all bureaucratic weight: Are you at your post? Are you ready to officiate? In a somewhat perfunctory sociological manner, we could say that Wagner&#x2019;s <i>Parsifal</i> is staging the historical fact that the classical Master (Amfortas) is no longer capable of reigning in the conditions of totalitarian bureaucracy and that he must be replaced by a new figure of a Leader (Parsifal).</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">In his film version of <i>Parsifal</i>, Hans-J&#x00FC;rgen Syberberg demonstrated &#x2013; by a series of changes to Wagner&#x2019;s original &#x2013; that he was well aware of this fact. First there is his manipulation of the sexual difference: at the crucial moment of inversion in the second act &#x2013; after Kundry&#x2019;s kiss &#x2013; Parsifal changes his sex: the male actor is replaced by a young, cold female; what is at stake here is no ideology of hermaphroditism but a shrewd insight into the &#x2018;feminine&#x2019; nature of totalitarian power, totalitarian Law is an obscene Law, penetrated by enjoyment, a Law which has lost its formal neutrality. But what is crucial for us here is another feature of Syberberg&#x2019;s version: the fact that he has <i>externalized</i> Amfortas&#x2019;s wound &#x2013; it is carried on a pillow beside him, as a nauseous partial object out of which, through <a id="page_84"/>an aperture resembling vaginal lips, trickles blood. Here we have the contiguity with Kafka: it is as if the child&#x2019;s wound from &#x2018;A Country Doctor&#x2019; has externalized itself, becoming a separate object, gaining independent existence or &#x2013; to use Lacan&#x2019;s style &#x2013; ex-sistence. That is why Syberberg stages the scene where, just before the final denouement, Amfortas desperately begs his attendants to run their swords through his body and so relieve him of his unbearable torments, in a way which differs radically from the customary way:</p><p class="noindent01 EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">Already I feel the darkness of death enshroud me,</p><p class="noindent0 EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">and must I yet again return to life?</p><p class="noindent0 EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">Madmen!

Plunge your swords</p><p class="noindent0 EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">in deep &#x2013; deep, up to the hilt!</p><p class="noindent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">The wound is Amfortas&#x2019;s symptom &#x2013; it embodies his filthy, nauseous enjoyment, it is his thickened, condensed life-substance which does not let him die. His words &#x2018;Here I am &#x2013; here is the open wound!&#x2019; are thus to be taken literally: all his being is in this wound; if we annihilate it, he himself will lose his positive ontological consistency and cease to exist. This scene is usually staged in accordance with Wagner&#x2019;s instructions: Amfortas tears open his garment and points at the bleeding wound on his body; with Syberberg, who has eternalized the wound, Amfortas points at the nauseous partial object outside himself &#x2013; that is, he does not point back at himself but there outside, in the sense of &#x2018;there outside I am, in that disgusting piece of the real consists all my substance!&#x2019; How should we read this externality?</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">The first, most obvious solution is to conceive this wound as a <i>symbolic</i> one: the wound is externalized to show that it does not concern the body as such but the symbolic network into which the body is caught. To put <a id="page_85"/>it simply: the real reason for Amfortas&#x2019;s impotence, and therewith for the decay of his kingdom, is a certain blockage, a certain snag in the network of symbolic relations. &#x2018;Something is rotten&#x2019; in this country where the ruler has trespassed a fundamental prohibition (he allowed himself to be seduced by Kundry); the wound is then just a materialization of a moral-symbolic decay.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">But there is another, perhaps more radical reading: in so far as it sticks out from the (symbolic and symbolized) reality of the body, the wound is &#x2018;a little piece of real&#x2019;, a disgusting protuberance which cannot be integrated into the totality of &#x2018;our own body&#x2019;, a materialization of that which is &#x2018;in Amfortas more than Amfortas&#x2019; and is thereby &#x2013; according to the classic Lacanian formula &#x2013; destroying him.<sup><a href="16_NotesJohnBrownvlthmfuwrmefx8621onbsyetochqcom.xhtml#ch2fn11" id="ch2fnr11">11</a></sup> It is destroying him, but at the same time it is the only thing which gives him consistency. This is the paradox of the psychoanalytic concept of the symptom: symptom is an element clinging on like a kind of parasite and &#x2018;spoiling the game&#x2019;, but if we annihilate it things get even worse: we lose all we had &#x2013; even the rest which was threatened but not yet destroyed by the symptom. Confronted with the symptom we are always in a position of an impossible choice; illustrated by a well-known joke about the chief editor of one of Hearst&#x2019;s newspapers: in spite of persuasion from Hearst, he did not want to take well-deserved leave. When Hearst asked him why he did not want to go on his holidays, the editor&#x2019;s answer was: &#x2018;I am afraid that if I were absent for a couple of weeks, the sales of the newspaper would fall; but I am even more afraid that in spite of my absence, the sales would <i>not</i> fall!&#x2019; This is the symptom: an element which causes a great deal of trouble, but its absence would mean even greater trouble: total catastrophe.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">To take, as a final example, Ridley Scott&#x2019;s film <i>Alien</i>: is not the disgusting parasite which jumps out of the body of poor John Hurt precisely such a symptom, is not its status precisely the same as that of Amfortas&#x2019;s externalized wound? The cave on the desert planet into which the space travellers enter when the computer registers signs of life in it, and where the <a id="page_86"/>polyp-like parasite sticks on to Hurt&#x2019;s face, has the status of the presymbolic Thing &#x2013; that is, of the maternal body, of the living substance of enjoyment. The utero-vaginal associations aroused by this cave are almost too intrusive. The parasite adhering to Hurt&#x2019;s face is thus a kind of a &#x2018;sprout of enjoyment&#x2019;, a leftover of the maternal Thing which then functions as a symptom &#x2013; the Real of enjoyment &#x2013; of the group marooned in the wandering spaceship: it threatens them and at the same time constitutes them as a closed group. The fact that this parasitical object incessantly changes its form merely confirms its <i>anamorphic</i> status: it is a pure being of semblance. The &#x2018;alien&#x2019;, the eighth, supplementary passenger, is an object which, being nothing at all in itself, must none the less be added, annexed as an anamorphic surplus. It is the Real at its purest: a semblance, something which on a strictly symbolic level does not exist at all but at the same time the only thing in the whole film which actually exists, the thing against which the whole reality is utterly defenceless. One has only to remember the spine-chilling scene when the liquid pouring from the polyp-like parasite after the doctor makes an incision with a scalpel dissolves the metal floor of the space ship &#x2026;</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">From this perspective of <i>sinthome</i>, truth and enjoyment are radically incompatible: the dimension of truth is opened through our misrecognition of the traumatic Thing, embodying the impossible <i>jouissance</i>.</p><p class="noindent1 EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart"><i>Ideological jouissance</i></p><p class="noindent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">With the designation of an inconsistency of the socio-symbolic Other, the positive side of which is obscene enjoyment, have we not consented also to the usual &#x2018;postmodernist&#x2019; anti-Enlightenment <i>ressentiment</i>? The text on the cover of the French edition of Lacan&#x2019;s <i>&#x00C9;crits</i> already belies such an understanding: Lacan conceives there his theoretical effort explicitly as a prolongation of the old struggle of Enlightenment. The Lacanian criticism of the autonomous subject and his power of reflection, of reflexive appropriation of his objective condition, is therefore far from any affirmation of some irrational ground escaping the reach of reason. Paraphrasing the <a id="page_87"/>well-known Marxian formula of capital itself as the limit of capitalism, we should say that according to Lacan the limit of Enlightenment is Enlightenment itself, its usually forgotten obverse already articulated in Descartes and Kant.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">The leading motif of the Enlightenment is, of course, some variation of the injunction &#x2018;Reason autonomously!&#x2019;: &#x2018;Use your own head, free yourself of all prejudices, do not accept anything without questioning its rational foundations, always preserve a critical distance &#x2026; &#x2019;. But Kant had already, in his famous article &#x2018;What is Enlightenment?&#x2019;, added to this an unpleasant, disquieting supplement, introducing a certain fissure into the very heart of the Enlightenment project: &#x2018;Reason about whatever you want and as much as you want &#x2013; but <i>obey</i>!&#x2019; That is to say: as the autonomous subject of theoretical reflection, addressing the enlightened public, you can think freely, you can question all authority; but as a part of the social &#x2018;machine&#x2019;, as a subject in the other meaning of the word, you must obey unconditionally the orders of your superiors. This fissure is proper to the project of Enlightenment as such: we find it already with Descartes, in his <i>Discourse on Method</i>. The obverse of the <i>cogito</i> doubting everything, questioning the very existence of the world, is the Cartesian &#x2018;provisional morality&#x2019;, a set of rules established by Descartes to enable him to survive in the everyday existence of his philosophical journey: the very first rule emphasizes the need to accept and obey the customs and laws of the country into which we were born without questioning their authority.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">The main point is to perceive how this acceptance of given empirical, &#x2018;pathological&#x2019; (Kant) customs and rules is not some kind of pre-Enlightenment remnant &#x2013; a remnant of the traditional authoritarian attitude &#x2013; but, on the contrary, <i>the necessary obverse of the Enlightenment itself</i> : through this acceptance of the customs and rules of social life in their nonsensical, given character, through acceptance of the fact that &#x2018;Law is law&#x2019;, we are internally freed from its constraints &#x2013; the way is open for free theoretical reflection. In other words, we render unto Caesar what is Caesar&#x2019;s, so that we can calmly reflect on everything. This experience of the given, non-founded character of customs and social rules entails in <a id="page_88"/>itself a kind of distance from them. In the traditional, pre-enlightened universe, the authority of the Law is never experienced as nonsensical and unfounded; on the contrary, the Law is always illuminated by the charismatic power of fascination. Only to the already enlightened view does the universe of social customs and rule appear as a nonsensical &#x2018;machine&#x2019; that must be accepted as such.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">Of course, we could say that the principal illusion of the Enlightenment consists in the idea that we can preserve a simple distance from the external &#x2018;machine&#x2019; of social customs and thus keep the space of our inner reflection spotless, unblemished by the externality of customs. But this criticism does not affect Kant in so far as in his affirmation of the categorical imperative he has taken into account the traumatic, truth-less, non-sensical character of the internal, moral Law itself. The Kantian categorical imperative is precisely a Law which has a necessary, unconditional authority, without being true: it is &#x2013; in Kant&#x2019;s own words &#x2013; a kind of &#x2018;transcendental fact&#x2019;, a given fact the truth of which cannot be theoretically demonstrated; but its unconditional validity should nonetheless be presupposed for our moral activity to have any sense.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">We can contrast this moral Law and the &#x2018;pathological&#x2019;, empirically given social laws through a whole set of distinctive features: social laws structure a field of social <i>reality</i>, moral Law is the <i>Real</i> of an unconditional imperative which takes no consideration of the limitations imposed on us by reality &#x2013; it is an impossible injunction. &#x2018;You can, because you must! [<i>Du kannst</i>, <i>denn du sollst!</i>]&#x2019;; social laws pacify our egotism and regulate social homeostasis; moral Law creates imbalance in this homeostasis by introducing an element of unconditional compulsion. The ultimate paradox of Kant is this priority of practical over theoretical reason: we can free ourselves of external social constraints and achieve the maturity proper to the autonomous enlightened subject precisely by submitting to the &#x2018;irrational&#x2019; compulsion of the categorical imperative.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">It is a commonplace of Lacanian theory to emphasize how this Kantian moral imperative conceals an obscene superego injunction: &#x2018;Enjoy!&#x2019; &#x2013; the voice of the Other impelling us to follow our duty for the sake of duty is <a id="page_89"/>a traumatic irruption of an appeal to impossible <i>jouissance</i>, disrupting the homeostasis of the pleasure principle and its prolongation, the reality principle. This is why Lacan conceives Sade as the truth of Kant: &#x2018;Kant avec Sade&#x2019;.<sup><a href="16_NotesJohnBrownvlthmfuwrmefx8621onbsyetochqcom.xhtml#ch2fn12" id="ch2fnr12">12</a></sup> But in what precisely does this obscenity of the moral Law consist? Not in some remnants, leftovers of the empirical &#x2018;pathological&#x2019; contents sticking to the pure form of the Law and smudging it, but <i>in this form itself</i>. The moral Law is obscene in so far as it is its form itself which functions as a motivating force driving us to obey its command &#x2013; that is, in so far as we obey moral Law because it is law and not because of a set of positive reasons: the obscenity of moral Law is the obverse of its formal character.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">Of course, the elementary feature of Kant&#x2019;s ethics is to exclude all empirical, &#x2018;pathological&#x2019; contents &#x2013; in other words, all objects producing pleasure (or displeasure) &#x2013; as the locus of our moral activity, but what remains hidden in Kant is the way this renunciation itself produces a certain surplus-enjoyment (the Lacanian <i>plus-de-jouir</i>). Let us take the case of Fascism &#x2013; the Fascist ideology is based upon a purely formal imperative: Obey, because you must! In other words, renounce enjoyment, sacrifice yourself and do not ask about the meaning of it &#x2013; the value of the sacrifice lies in its very meaninglessness; true sacrifice is for its own end; you must find positive fulfilment in the sacrifice itself, not in its instrumental value: it is this renunciation, this giving up of enjoyment itself, which produces a certain surplus-enjoyment.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">This surplus produced through renunciation is the Lacanian <i>objet petit a</i>, the embodiment of surplus-enjoyment; here we can also grasp why Lacan coined the notion of surplus-enjoyment on the model of the Marxian notion of surplus-value &#x2013; with Marx, surplus-value also implies a certain renunciation of &#x2018;pathological&#x2019;, empirical use-value. And Fascism is obscene in so far as it perceives directly the ideological form as its own end, as an end in itself &#x2013; remember Mussolini&#x2019;s famous answer to the question &#x2018;How do the Fascists justify their claim to rule Italy? What is their programme?&#x2019; &#x2018;Our programme is very simple: we want to rule Italy!&#x2019; The ideological <a id="page_90"/>power of Fascism lies precisely in the feature which was perceived by liberal or leftist critics as its greatest weakness: in the utterly void, formal character of its appeal, in the fact that it demands obedience and sacrifice for their own sake. For Fascist ideology, the point is not the instrumental value of the sacrifice, it is the very form of sacrifice itself, &#x2018;the spirit of sacrifice&#x2019;, which is the cure against the liberal-decadent disease. It is also clear why Fascism was so terrified by psychoanalysis: psychoanalysis enables us to locate an obscene enjoyment at work in this act of formal sacrifice.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">This is the hidden perverse, obscene dimension of Kantian moral formalism finally appearing in Fascism: it is here that Kantian formalism rejoins &#x2013; or, more precisely, explicates &#x2013; the logic of the second of Descartes&#x2019;s maxims of provisional morality:</p><blockquote><p class="noindent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">&#x2026; that of being as firm and resolute in my actions as I could be, and not to follow less faithfully opinions the most dubious, when my mind was once made up regarding them, than if these had been beyond doubt. In this I should be following the example of travellers, who, finding themselves lost in a forest, know that they ought not to wander first to one side and then to the other, nor, still less, to stop in one place, but understand that they should continue to walk as straight as they can in one direction, not diverging for any slight reason, even though it was possibly chance alone that first determined them in their choice. By this means if they do not go exactly where they wish, they will at least arrive somewhere at the end, where probably they will be better off than in the middle of a forest.<sup><a href="16_NotesJohnBrownvlthmfuwrmefx8621onbsyetochqcom.xhtml#ch2fn13" id="ch2fnr13">13</a></sup></p></blockquote><p class="noindent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">In this passage, Descartes is in a way revealing the hidden cards of ideology as such: the real aim of ideology is the attitude demanded by it, the consistency of the ideological form, the fact that we &#x2018;continue to walk as straight as we can in one direction&#x2019;; the positive reasons given by ideology to justify this request &#x2013; to make us obey ideological form &#x2013; are there only to conceal <a id="page_91"/>this fact: in other words, to conceal the surplus-enjoyment proper to the ideological form as such.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">Here we could refer to the notion, introduced by Jon Elster, of &#x2018;states that are essentially by-products&#x2019; &#x2013; that is, states that could be produced only as non-intended, as the side-effect of our activity: as soon as we aim directly at them, as soon as our activity is directly motivated by them, our procedure becomes self-defeating. From a whole series of ideological examples evoked by Elster, let us take Tocqueville&#x2019;s justification of the jury system: &#x2018;I do not know whether a jury is useful to the litigants, but I am sure that it is very good for those who have to decide the case.

But the point is again that I can achieve this terrestrial profit only if I really believe in God, in the religious beyond; this is probably the hidden, rather cynical logic of Pascal&#x2019;s argument: although the real stake of religion is the terrestrial profit achieved by the religious attitude, this gain is a &#x2018;state that is essentially a by-product&#x2019; &#x2013; it can be produced only as a non-intended result of our belief in a religious beyond.</p><p class="indent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart"><a id="page_92"/>It should be no surprise to us that we find exactly the same argument in Rosa Luxemburg&#x2019;s description of the revolutionary process: at the beginning, the first workers&#x2019; struggles are doomed to fail, their direct aims cannot be achieved, but although they necessarily end in failure, their overall balance sheet is none the less positive because their main gain is educational &#x2013; that is to say, they serve the formation of the working class into the revolutionary subject. And again, the point is that if we (the Party) say directly to the fighting workers: &#x2018;It does not matter if you fail, the main point of your struggle is its educational effect on you&#x2019;, the educational effect will be lost.</p><p class="noindent EPubfirstparagraph ePubPagerstart">It is as if Descartes, in the quoted passage, is giving us, perhaps for the first time, the pure form of this fundamental ideological paradox: what is really at stake in ideology is its form, the fact that we continue to walk as straight as we can in one direction, that we follow even the most dubious opinions once our mind has been made up regarding them; but this ideological attitude can be achieved only as a &#x2018;state that is essentially by-product&#x2019;: the ideological subjects, &#x2018;travellers lost in a forest&#x2019;, must conceal from themselves the fact that &#x2018;it was possibly chance alone that first determined them in their choice&#x2019;; they must believe that their decision is well founded, that it will lead to their Goal. As soon as they perceive that <i>the real goal is the consistency of the ideological attitude itself</i>, the effect is self-defeating.
